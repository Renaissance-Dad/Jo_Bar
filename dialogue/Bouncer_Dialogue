"You absolute fuckin legend! I've been saying to Danny to get the gutter fixed for ages! Thanks!"

The bouncer takes the umbrella from you and happily props it over his head.

"Oh, //you're// the new bartender? Well, shit, you should've said."

He stands aside to let you in. 

"The main entrance is round the front, but the other barstaff usually use this door to go for ''smoke breaks''."

There is a broad shouldered bouncer leaning against the doorframe, unsuccessfully trying to avoid getting his hair wet.

He looks you up and down. A droplet of rain follows the shaved slit in his eyebrow straight into his left eye. He blinks furiously. He suddenly seems much less intimidating. 

"And where have you been tonight, pal?" he asks, gaze shifting from your face to your hands. He's trying to work out how sober you are.
